Climber: mathew
Fingers — common climbing issue: Pulley strain/sprain (A2/A4) or general tendon irritation
Prevention: Thorough warm-up, open-hand gripping, gradual loading, avoid sudden max crimping.
Recovery (general): Relative rest, avoid painful grips, gentle range-of-motion; seek professional guidance if pain persists.
Note: Stop if pain increases. Consider seeing a sports PT or physician.

Recommended general warm-up (10–15 min):
1) 5–7 min easy cardio or traversing to raise temperature.
2) Joint prep: wrists, shoulders, elbows through gentle ranges.
3) Movement ramps: 2–3 very easy boulders/routes, gradually increasing difficulty, open-hand grips first.
4) Finger prep: light hangs or big holds only if pain-free.
